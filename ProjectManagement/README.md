# Project Management Files for Inverted Pendulum Project

This directory contains the project management and planning artifacts developed during the inverted pendulum project.

## Overview

These files document the application of project management techniques to the inverted pendulum project, including scheduling, risk management, responsibility assignment, and project planning.

## File Structure

### Project Planning
- `MindMap.mm`: Mind map file showing overall project structure
- `WBS.xlsx`: Work Breakdown Structure spreadsheet
- `GanttChart.mpp`: Microsoft Project Gantt chart with project timeline
- `NetworkDiagram.xlsx`: Project network diagram with dependencies
- `ABMEstimates.xlsx`: A-B-M estimates for task durations
- `CriticalPath.xlsx`: Critical path analysis
- `RACI.xlsx`: Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RACI)
- `SlackAnalysis.xlsx`: Slack time calculations for project activities

### Risk Management
- `RiskMatrix.xlsx`: Risk assessment matrix (probability vs. impact)
- `Fishbone.pptx`: Ishikawa (fishbone) diagram for identifying problem causes
- `FMEA.xlsx`: Failure Modes and Effects Analysis
- `SecurityAnalysis.docx`: Security threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies
- `PowerInterestGrid.pptx`: Stakeholder power-interest grid
- `CommitmentAssessment.xlsx`: Commitment assessment matrix

## Key Project Metrics

- **Project Duration**: 48 working days (January 16, 2025 to March 24, 2025)
- **Critical Path**: 1a → 1b → 2a → 4c → 4d → 4f → 5a → 6a → 6c
- **Project Completion Time**: 24.1 days
- **Completion Probability**: ~100% by project deadline

## Risk Analysis

The project identified several key risks:
- Sensor noise and drift (High probability, Low impact)
- Bluetooth connection failure (High probability, High impact)
- Mechanical damage during prototyping (Medium probability, Low impact)
- Incorrect LQR parameter tuning (Medium probability, Medium impact)
- Component overheating (Low probability, Medium impact)
- Incorrect motor driver wiring (Low probability, High impact)

## Team Responsibilities

The RACI matrix defines responsibilities for each project task across team members:
- Daniel Helmi
- Muhammad Maaz
- Arjun Bhaduri
- Rehan Agrawal

Each task has clearly defined Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed assignments.
