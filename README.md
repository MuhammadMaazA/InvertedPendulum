# Inverted Pendulum Project

This repository contains the complete implementation of an inverted pendulum system developed for the COMP0216 - Systems Engineering for Real-time Systems course at UCL (Term 2, January - March 2025).

## Project Overview

The inverted pendulum project demonstrates the application of systems engineering principles to design, simulate, and build a control system that stabilizes a pendulum in an upright position by controlling the force applied to a cart.

## Repository Structure

- **[Arduino](/Arduino)**: Contains the firmware for controlling the physical inverted pendulum system
- **[Simulation](/Simulation)**: Contains Python code to simulate the inverted pendulum dynamics and controllers
- **[SysML](/SysML)**: Contains the Model-Based Systems Engineering artifacts created with Eclipse Papyrus
- **[ProjectManagement](/ProjectManagement)**: Contains project planning and management files

## Team Members

- Muhammad Maaz
- Daniel Helmi
- Arjun Bhaduri
- Rehan Agrawal

## Key Features

- Mathematical modeling of inverted pendulum dynamics
- Multiple control strategies (PID, pole placement, nonlinear controller)
- Sensor noise simulation and filtering
- MBSE with SysML diagrams
- Real-time visualization and interactive parameter tuning
- Physical prototype implementation with ELEGOO components
